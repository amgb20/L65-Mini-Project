Investigating what structural properties are most desirable to preserve in rewiring and positional encodings for GNNs and graph transformers

## Description

## Version Control Commands

To collaborate effectively and avoid conflicts while working on different parts of the project, you can use the following Git commands:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Create a new branch**:
    ```sh
    git checkout -b <branch_name>
    ```

3. **Switch to an existing branch**:
    ```sh
    git checkout <branch_name>
    ```

4. **Add changes to the staging area**:
    ```sh
    git add <file_name>
    ```

5. **Commit changes**:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Commit message describing the changes"
    ```

6. **Pull the latest changes from the remote repository**:
    ```sh
    git pull origin <branch_name>
    ```

7. **Push changes to the remote repository**:
    ```sh
    git push origin <branch_name>
    ```

8. **Merge changes from one branch to another**:
    ```sh
    git checkout <target_branch>
    git merge <source_branch>
    ```

9. **Resolve merge conflicts**:
    - Open the conflicting files and manually resolve the conflicts.
    - Add the resolved files to the staging area:
      ```sh
      git add <resolved_file>
      ```
    - Commit the resolved changes:
      ```sh
      git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
      ```

10. **Delete a branch**:
     ```sh
     git branch -d <branch_name>
     ```

11. **View the commit history**:
     ```sh
     git log
     ```
12. **View the status of the working tree**:
     ```sh
     git status
     ```
